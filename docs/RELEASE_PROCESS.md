# Release Process

## Overview

ConfigIQ uses semantic versioning with git tags to trigger container builds and version the UI.

The build workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) produces **three container
images in unison** from a single run — the webapp plus the two backend services
under `services/` — always sharing the same tags so a given version denotes the
three that shipped together:

- `ghcr.io/redhat-performance/configiq` (Next.js webapp)
- `ghcr.io/redhat-performance/aiconfigurator` (GPU sizing / estimation API)
- `ghcr.io/redhat-performance/aicostings` (GPU / LLM pricing API)

The matrix runs `fail-fast`, so if any one image fails to build, none of the
three publish — the tag is all-or-nothing across all three.

## Creating a Release

1. **Update package.json version** (optional, for npm tracking):
   ```bash
   npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
   ```
   Use `patch`, `minor`, or `major` depending on the type of release.

2. **Create and push a signed git tag** (replace `vX.Y.Z` with the release version):
   ```bash
   git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
   The `-s` flag creates a signed tag for release verification. The `-m` flag provides the tag message.

3. **GitHub Actions automatically**:
   - Triggers the build workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
   - Builds **all three** container images (see Overview)
   - Pushes each to GHCR with matching tags:
     - `ghcr.io/redhat-performance/{configiq,aiconfigurator,aicostings}:X.Y.Z` (specific version)
     - `ghcr.io/redhat-performance/{configiq,aiconfigurator,aicostings}:latest` (most recent release)

## Version Display in UI

The sidebar footer shows:
- **Version**: From git tag (via `NEXT_PUBLIC_GIT_VERSION`)
- **Commit**: Short git hash (via `NEXT_PUBLIC_GIT_COMMIT`)
- **Build time**: UTC timestamp (via `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIME`)

These are injected at build time by `scripts/inject-build-metadata.js`.

## Container Tags

All three images carry the same tag set:

- **`latest`** - Most recent tagged release (release-tracking; the `.xyz` host follows this)
- **`dev`** - Latest commit from `main` (commit-tracking; the `.dev` host follows this)
- **`X.Y.Z`** - Specific version tags

The two-host tag model (`.dev` → `:dev`, `.xyz` → `:latest`) is implemented in
the `configiq-deploy` repo; `podman auto-update` on each host polls whatever tag
its running containers use, so the per-host tag is the only lever.

## Container Registry

Published containers:

- https://github.com/redhat-performance/configiq/pkgs/container/configiq
- https://github.com/redhat-performance/configiq/pkgs/container/aiconfigurator
- https://github.com/redhat-performance/configiq/pkgs/container/aicostings

## Bumping the aiconfigurator SDK

The `aiconfigurator` and `aicostings` services install the `aiconfigurator` SDK
(and its Rust-compiled `aiconfigurator-core`) as wheels from the Red Hat fork's
GitHub Release assets — not PyPI. They are referenced by **exact download URL**
rather than `name==version`, because NVIDIA publishes the same `0.11.0` on PyPI
with an incompatible `numpy~=1.26.4` pin that would otherwise shadow the fork's
`numpy>=2.1,<3` build and make the install unresolvable. A direct URL forces pip
to install the exact fork artifacts regardless of what PyPI serves.

To move to a new SDK build, update the two wheel URLs — keep them **identical in
both files** — in lockstep:

1. `services/aiconfigurator/pyproject.toml` — the `aiconfigurator @ …` and
   `aiconfigurator-core @ …` entries in `[project.dependencies]`.
2. `services/aicostings/pyproject.toml` — the same two entries.

Each URL points at a specific `deploy-api-v<version>+<hash>` release asset (the
`+` in the tag is URL-encoded as `%2B`); never the rolling `deploy-api-latest`,
so rebuilds are reproducible. The wheels are produced by the fork's
`deploy-api-wheels.yml` workflow on its `deploy/api` branch.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by the `configiq-deploy` repo (rootless Podman + systemd
quadlets + nginx on IBM Cloud VMs). To pull an image manually:

**Production** (`:latest`):
```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/redhat-performance/configiq:latest
```

**Development** (`:dev`):
```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/redhat-performance/configiq:dev
```

## Rollback

To roll back, deploy a previous tagged version (do so for all three images so
they stay in the version lockstep they shipped in):
```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/redhat-performance/configiq:X.Y.Z
```

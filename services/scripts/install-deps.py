"""Install a service's runtime dependencies from its own pyproject.toml.

Shared by the service Containerfiles (aiconfigurator, aicostings) so each
service's [project.dependencies] list is the single source of truth. A
hand-copied duplicate in the Containerfile previously drifted from pyproject
and dropped a dependency (ijson), crash-looping the container at runtime.

configiq is the one dep filtered out here: it's the shared library, a path
dependency installed separately from the source copy at /src/configiq-py (there
is no `configiq` on PyPI to resolve). Everything else passes straight to pip,
including the aiconfigurator SDK + its Rust-compiled core — pyproject.toml pins
those by exact GitHub-Release download URL (`name @ https://…whl`) so pip installs
the fork's exact artifacts rather than the same-versioned, numpy-incompatible
packages NVIDIA ships to PyPI.

Runs under whichever interpreter invokes it (`sys.executable -m pip`), so it
targets the venv in aiconfigurator's image and the system Python in aicostings'.

Usage:
  python install-deps.py <path-to-pyproject.toml> [extra pip args ...]

Any extra argv (e.g. --find-links, --index-url) is forwarded to pip verbatim.
